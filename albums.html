    <p>Astroworld (stylized in all caps) is the third studio album by American rapper Travis Scott. 
        It was released on August 3, 2018, through Cactus Jack Records and Grand Hustle Records, and distributed by Epic Records. 
        The album features guest vocals from Frank Ocean, Drake, Swae Lee, Kid Cudi, James Blake, Philip Bailey, Juice Wrld, Sheck Wes,

        Birds in the Trap Sing McKnight (2016), and his collaborative album with Quavo, Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho (2017).

        The album title is named after the defunct theme park Six Flags AstroWorld, which was located in Houston, Texas prior to its closure.
         Scott, a Houston native, aimed for the album to sound like "taking an amusement park away from kids". 
         He also described the album as a continuation of his debut album Rodeo (2015).
          Astroworld is a hip hop and psychedelic rap album, incorporating elements of trap and psychedelic music. 
          The album was supported by four singles, "Butterfly Effect", "Sicko Mode", "Yosemite", and "Wake Up".</p>
